# Kindling - FHIR Sentence Labeling Tool

Kindling is an open-source Python tool designed to create labeled FHIR sentences from FHIR resources represented in JSON format. It flattens nested JSON structures, commonly used to represent FHIR resources, into a flat dictionary with labeled keys corresponding to the paths in the nested structure.

## Introduction

FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) is a standard for exchanging healthcare information electronically. FHIR resources are often represented in JSON format, which can contain nested structures. Kindling simplifies the process of converting these nested structures into flat labeled dictionaries, making it easier for downstream applications such as natural language processing and data analysis.

## Installation

To use Kindling, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website: [Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

You can then clone the Kindling repository and install the required dependencies using the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/kindling.git
cd kindling
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage
To use Kindling, you can import the flatten_fhir function from the kindling.py module in your own scripts. Here's a basic example of how to use the tool:
```
from kindling import flatten_fhir

# Example nested JSON FHIR resource
nested_json = {
    "resourceType": "Patient",
    "name": [
        {
            "given": "John",
            "family": "Doe"
        }
    ]
}

flat_dict = flatten_fhir(nested_json)
print(flat_dict)
```
